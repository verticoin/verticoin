Description: peer-to-peer network based demurrage currency - daemon
 VertiCoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that

 trusted parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and
 transact directly with each other, with the help of a P2P network to
 check for double-spending.  VertiCoin features built-in demurrage to
 encourage long-term thinking, low interest rates, and a high velocity
 of money.

 Full transaction history is stored locally at each client.
